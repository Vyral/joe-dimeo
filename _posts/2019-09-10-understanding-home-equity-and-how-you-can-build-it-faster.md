Whenever you hear about mortgages or homeownership, equity is a central part of that conversation. It’s important to understand this term if you plan to buy a home at some point in the future, so there’s no shame in asking, **“What is home equity?”&nbsp;**

Essentially, **equity is the difference between what you owe and what the property is valued at.** We’ll discuss how property is assigned value at another time. Essentially, though, equity is the money left over after any underlying liens are satisfied on your home.

The best part? It’s yours to keep\! But how can you earn it more quickly? Well, **you’ll first need to understand the repayment structure of your loan.** In other words, when you look at the entire timeline of a 30-year loan, realize that the first few years will be spent largely paying down your interest, with a small portion going toward the principal balance.&nbsp;

Then, at the halfway point, the ratio becomes 50/50—50% principal and 50% interest. As you approach the end of that 30-year period, you’ll almost entirely be paying toward the principal and building equity in the meantime. Now, you do have options for adjusting the amount of interest you’re paying at a given point, but we’ll get to that in a later video.&nbsp;
