People often ask me whether it’s a good idea to refinance their home.

In answer, I ask them three questions:

* **Has the market improved?** If the market in your area has gone up significantly over the last couple of years, meaning that money is actually cheaper, then you can absolutely refinance your home, potentially pull equity from it, and lower your payments.

* **Have you done substantial improvements to the home?** If, for example, you added some decks or really nice landscaping to your property, the value of your home will increase, potentially leading to a higher appraisal and loan-to-value ratio. Many good things can happen when it shows good ownership of a home and improvements in the value of the asset the bank has lent on because that’s ultimately what the banks are after. Someone who shows that they can make a home better after living in it and makes their payments on time is a less risky person to loan to.
* **Has your credit improved?** If you borrowed money when you had a credit score of 550 and you’re now at a 750, you represent less of a risk to the bank. There’s no reason to pay more in interest than is necessary.

Do you want to stop wasting money on interest and find out what risk you represent to bank? If so, then reach out to me. We can help you make sure that you’re not overpaying.<br>&nbsp;
