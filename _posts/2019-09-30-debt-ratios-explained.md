When you hear the term “debt ratio,” you probably are a little unclear as to what this means. If that’s the case, don’t worry. Today, I’ll explain what you need to know about this common real estate term. Essentially, there are two types of debt ratio: front-end debt ratios and back-end debt ratios. Your front-end debt ratio is the amount you spend on housing compared to how much you make each month. Your back-end debt ratio is how much you make each month compared to how much your total debt is, including your mortgage. Keeping both of these ratios steady while you’re in the process of buying a home is important, but having too high a ratio could prevent you from getting approved for a loan at all. Ultimately, it’s important to have a discussion with your lender about your circumstances to better understand how these ratios will impact your goals. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
