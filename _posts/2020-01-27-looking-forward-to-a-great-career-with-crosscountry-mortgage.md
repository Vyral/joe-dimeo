Now that I’ve made the switch from Fairway to CrossCountry Mortgage, I wanted to take a moment to thank all my friends at Fairway for the great learning experience working there provided me. I had a really fun time\! But like I said, now I work with CrossCountry Mortgage, which has a really great team and new products at your disposal. If, say, you wanted to build a house to your specific tastes, we’ve got a product for you. If you’re a contractor or a fix-and-flipper, we have resources to help you, as well.&nbsp;

2020 is going to be a great year\! If you’re in the market for a new home, think of me over at CrossCountry Mortgage.
