On behalf of Joe DiMeo and Shelby Campbell, we have an exciting announcement to make: We’re teaming up in order to bring you the best educational video content possible from the world of mortgage lending. We both bring a wealth of knowledge to the industry, and our skill sets correspond in a fantastic way. Between the two of us, we’ve found that we can provide a high level of service, so be on the lookout for future videos featuring the two of us. You can still reach out to both of us the same way you always have.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this announcement or if there’s anything else we can help you with, don’t hesitate to give us a shout. We’d love to help you.&nbsp;
