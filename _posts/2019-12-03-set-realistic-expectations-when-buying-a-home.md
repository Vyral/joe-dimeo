I saw an Instagram meme the other day that said, “My wife is a stay-at-home astronaut, and I breed salamanders. Our budget is $3 million.” This, of course, was referring to the “House Hunters” series on HGTV.

Unfortunately, though, this is a situation many people actually have to face. Everyone wants the house on a hill that comes with a pool, is located in the perfect school district, and sits within walking distance of their favorite coffee shop. The problem is that money talks, and if you’re not in the price bracket that allows you to buy a home with these features,&nbsp;**you’ll have to make sacrifices to get the home that’s best-suited for you.**

This is why it’s important to set realistic expectations and know your budget when buying a home. A great rule of thumb is to pick your absolute “must-have” features, and for every $100,000 you’re willing to spend, add one of them.&nbsp;

Maybe the home you buy today isn’t the one you’ll end up in for the rest of your life, but if you buy and sell it the right way, it may lead you to your dream home someday. Don’t be discouraged by the fact that you can’t get everything you want right away. **Set realistic expectations and make sure you don’t end up “house poor”** (i.e., spending every penny you have just to cover your house payments).&nbsp;

Remember—what you sacrifice today may help you gain something you want in the future.

If you need help setting realistic expectations and planning your budget for your home purchase so that you get the home you need, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to refer you to a great real estate agent who can help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
