Have you ever seen the Tom Hanks movie, “The Money Pit?” Keep this in mind if you’re thinking about buying a fixer-upper.&nbsp;

**If you're buying one of these kinds of properties, you need to understand that you’re starting to undertake a full-time second job.** It depends on the extent, but you’re going to be living in a construction site. It’s a great way to build equity or make some money, but there’s no such thing as easy money.&nbsp;

If this sounds like something you could handle, but you don’t want to live with the constant construction, I have great news. There’s a program out there called the 203(k) rehab loan. **It allows you to find that perfect fixer-upper, make the updates and improvements before you move in, and move into a fully remodeled home.&nbsp;**
