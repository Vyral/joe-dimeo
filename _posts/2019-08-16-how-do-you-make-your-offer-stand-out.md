For homebuyers, one of the common questions we hear is, “How do I make my offer stand out?”

**Your real estate agent is a good place to start.** You hired them for a reason, and that reason should be to get you the best property for the best price. If you need a referral, please let me know because I know some great agents.

As for my advice, I always suggest starting with the seller's motivation. A handwritten letter makes you look desperate and overly emotional in my opinion. If you understand the seller’s motivation, you can craft your offer to fit their needs. **You don’t have to come in with a high price, but you can offer a quick close or waive a contingency or two.** This will help everyone feel like they left the transaction a winner.&nbsp;

So if you do need any recommendations for real estate agents or you have any questions regarding real estate or mortgages in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
