Today we’re talking about all things short sales. If you don’t know already, **a short sale occurs when a bank or other financial institution decides to let go of an asset (in this case, a home) for less than they owe on that property.** When the crash happened in 2008, banks decided to do a lot of short sales to get all of the losses off their balance sheet.

What do short sales mean for homebuyers? It means that you have to get the bank’s approval to get the property bought. It also means that you’ll be able to buy a home for less than the bank paid for it.&nbsp;

If you want to buy a home through a short sale, here's how the process works. **You submit your offer to a bank, they set you up with an underwriter, and the bank will determine how much of a loss they’re willing to take on the property.** You can get a great deal on one of these homes, but you need to have the right agent who can help you navigate these situations and get your offer accepted. I’d be happy to recommend an agent to you.

If you need that recommendation or have any other questions about buying a home, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
